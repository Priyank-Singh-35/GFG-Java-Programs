# 🌟 GFG-Java-Programs 🌟

Welcome to the **GFG-Java-Programs** repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the GeeksForGeeks course titled "Data Structures & Algorithm - Self Paced". Each problem is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach, including time and space complexity analysis.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Navigate through the repository with ease! Each directory represents a specific type of data structure or algorithm category. Inside, you'll find well-commented Java code files that explain the logic, steps, and complexity analysis for each implementation.

## 📜 Contents

### 🏗️ Data Structures
